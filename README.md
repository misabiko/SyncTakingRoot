A small script to that opens a video from Scruffy's Animal Crossing: Taking Root playlist synced at the current time of day.

Tested on Google Chrome version 104.0.5112.102

# How to use
No need to download or clone the repo.

Add a new page in your bookmarks, add "javascript:" to its url, and then copy paste the content of either syncTakingRoot.js or syncTakingRoot.min.js after it.

Then clicking on the bookmark should either jump to the right video, or if you're already on it, change the timestamp to the right time.
